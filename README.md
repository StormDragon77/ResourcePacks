# [Stormilla](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fixed-inconsistencies/)

This github repository is used as an issue tracker, wiki and file archive. Releases can be found on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/stormilla) and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/stormilla).<br />[PlanetMinecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fixed-inconsistencies/) has links to latest downloads only.

You can suggest or report a bug by opening a new issue in Issues. You can also open an issue for wiki changes.

Stormilla only supports the latest release of Minecraft (and potentially previous patches if mods aren't updated yet). The only mods Stormilla currently supports are the latest release of OptiFine and Fabric equivalents that use the OptiFine format.

# [Discord](https://discord.gg/e5CKcu2G6c)
You can also leave a suggestion or bug report in my discord server + get access to exclussive previews and even *very occasional* beta releases.

If you need to contact Storm to ask about the pack or if you want to use assets, you can do so through [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/e5CKcu2G6c) in #help or PMC: [StormDragon77](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/stormdragon77/). You should get a reply within a day. (Do NOT contact me about making you a resource pack for free, the answer is no. I do not take requests.)

# Leaving an Issue:

- Please put different ideas and bug reports in their own issues. This makes it easier to track what has and hasn't been done.
- If an issue is closed but is not in the latest release, it will be in the next one unless marked with declined.

------------------------------
### BUGS:
- Your bug will be marked invalid/declined if it cannot be reproduced, it isn't a problem relating to this pack or if it is intended
- Describe your bug in detail and please include an image of the bug if necessary 
- Specify what platform you are on (Java or bedrock)
- Check if you have other resource packs on before reporting

------------------------------
### SUGGESTIONS:
- Your suggestion will be marked invalid/declined if it strays too far from vanilla, does not fit my vision or is impossible to add.
- <details><summary>Here's my design principles for this pack to show everything I plan on adding to this:</summary>
	- Fix Inconsistencies, fix every texture and model bug a resource pack can fix and also logical inconsistencies<br />
	- Art Style Consistency, Minecraft's current default pack isn't entirely consistent. Some models and textures look old whether they be over-detailed, under-detailed, have a messy color palette or are just a different art style. Some of these are on purpose such as diamond ore and the creeper due to their iconic look but I will still be updating those too anyway.<br />
	- Pixel Consistency, most of the game is already pixel consistent. There are just a few textures that have a different resolution compared to a block. If the pixels are not the same size as the ones on a normal block then it will be fixed if possible.<br />
	- Less Uniformity, most textures that is simply a recolor of an existing texture will be made more unique like the ore changes in 1.17 (as of right now, exceptions are things like wood planks, concrete, and terracotta.)<br />
	- Palette Consistency, Textures of the same material will have the same or a similar color palette (with possibly some exceptions such as iron block and anvil).<br />
	- Parity, Bedrock and java will be as similar as a resource pack allows.<br />
	- Slightly More Realism, Some things will be more realistic while not sacrificing the feel of vanilla.<br />
	- New Item Models, many items have a consistency problem like with the cauldron being 2D and composter 3D. They have no reason to be different. Some items also simply use the flat block texture instead of having a dedicated item texture. I'll be changing both of these.<br />
	- Vanilla Building Blocks, I may make tweaks to them but I will not be drastically changing them. I don't want your builds to look too different with this pack on.<br />
</details>

- Please don't request adding other people's assets. Most of the time the answer is no, I like making the assets myself. You can however request an idea from another pack that you like and I might do my own spin on it.
- If you are looking to contribute something, I am not looking for contributors currently but if you want you can still send something you made my way. Remember: there's no guarentee that it will get added and if it does you will of course be properly credited with your name and link in the description and credits.txt file within the pack.
- Suggestions that too drastically change building blocks will not be added (or could potentially be added via addon pack) I don't want this pack to drastically change the look of builds so your builds won't look weird for people who don't have this pack on.

# Old Versions:

All versions ever released are stored on mediaifre at the moment, this is because the project originally solely existed on PMC.

Note: The pack's name on releases prior to 2.0 were called Fixed Inconsistencies
